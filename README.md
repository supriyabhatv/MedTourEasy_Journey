### About Project
### Project Name:Analyze death age difference of left handers with right handers

### Problem Statement:
The problem statement for this project is to analyze the death age difference between left-handers and right-handers. We aim to determine whether there is 
a significant difference in the death age between the two groups and identify the factors that may influence this difference. The study will help to gain a 
better understanding of the impact of left-handedness on mortality and contribute to the existing body of research on this topic. The project will use 
statistical techniques and data visualization to analyze the data and draw conclusions.

### Objective:
This project involves analyzing the death age difference between left-handers 
and right-handers. The objective of this study is to investigate whether 
handedness is associated with differences in death age.

**About dataset:**
The dataset consists of 3 columns, each column representing an attribute!

- Age: This column represents the age of individuals in the dataset
- Male: This column indicates the count of male individuals in the dataset corresponding to each age group.
- Female: This column indicates the count of female individuals in the dataset corresponding to each age group.

### Project Workflow:
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   -  Handedness data from National Geographic Survey.
   -  Death distribution data for United States.
   -  Checking for null values or missing values in each column.
  
1. **Left-Handedness Analysis:**
   - Developed functions to compute the probability of being left-handed given the age at death.
   - Created a function to determine the overall probability of being left-handed if an individual died in a specific year.
  
1. **Right-Handedness Analysis:**
   - Formulated a function to calculate the overall probability of being right-handed if an individual died in a specific year.
   - Explored the complementary relationship between left-handedness and right-handedness probabilities.
  
1. **Age Probability Calculations:**
   - Estimated the probability of
