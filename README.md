### About Project
### Project Name:Analyze death age difference of left handers with right handers

### Problem Statement:
The problem statement for this project is to analyze the death age difference between left-handers and right-handers. We aim to determine whether there is 
a significant difference in the death age between the two groups and identify the factors that may influence this difference. The study will help to gain a 
better understanding of the impact of left-handedness on mortality and contribute to the existing body of research on this topic. The project will use 
statistical techniques and data visualization to analyze the data and draw conclusions.
